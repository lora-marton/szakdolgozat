When you run the demo, you will see two graphs stacked on top of each other. Here is what they represent:

1. Top Graph: "Before Alignment (Raw Mismatch)"

- What you see: A Blue Line (Teacher) and a Red Dashed Line (Student).
- The Problem: The Red line is "slower" (stretched out) and starts a bit late.
- The Result: Even though the shapes look similar, the peaks simply don't line up. If you calculated the distance vertically (frame-by-frame), the error would be huge, falsely suggesting the student is wrong.


2. Bottom Graph: "DTW Alignment (Elastic Matching)"

- What you see: The same two lines, but now connected by Gray Lines.
- The Magic: Notice how the gray lines are slanted.
	A peak in the Blue line is connected to the corresponding peak in the Red line, even though it happens later in time.
	DTW has found the "Elastic Path" to map one signal to the other.


Why this matters for your project:

The Cost (printed in the console) is the true difference in moves.

- Low Cost: "Great move! You just did it a bit slower." (Good Shape, Bad Timing).
- High Cost: "Wrong move completely." (Bad Shape).


By separating the Warping Path (Timing) from the path Cost (Shape), you can give the user specific feedback like "Right moves, but try to keep up with the beat!"
