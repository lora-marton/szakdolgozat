Walkthrough - Extractor 7 (Static Virtual Camera)
This extractor introduces a robust way to analyze dance videos by separating local body shape from global movement.

Changes

1. Extractor 7 Features

Feature			Description
FPS Boost 		Increased target extraction rate to 60 FPS for smoother motion.
Lag Reduction		Tuned OneEuroFilter (beta=20.0) for snappier response to fast dance moves.
Segmentation Mask	Extracts user silhouette (saved as compressed HDF5).
Follow-Cam		A virtual camera that tracks the hips to keep the dancer centered.
GPS Trajectory		Saves the camera's path so we don't lose the global movement info.


2. File Output Structure

The script produces two files:

- output/dance_data_processed.h5:
	raw: (N, 33, 4) - Original MediaPipe landmarks.
	trajectory: (N, 2) - The (x, y) coordinates of the hip center in the original video.
- output/dance_masks.h5:
	masks: (N, 256, 256) - Binary masks, centered on the dancer and normalized to a standard height.


Usage Guide for Comparison Model

When you train your detailed comparison model later, you will use:

1. Shape Comparison: Use the masks. Since the dancer is always centered and scaled, you can directly compare silhouettes (e.g., "Is the arm raised?").
2. Move Comparison: Use the trajectory. You can plot the path on the floor (e.g., "Did they step 1m to the right?").

This "Split Interaction" approach is robust against camera zoom, panning, and dancer height differences.
