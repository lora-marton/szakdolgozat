The One Euro Filter is a smoothing algorithm specifically designed to balance two conflicting goals in real-time tracking: reducing jitter (noise) and minimizing lag (latency).

It achieves this by dynamically changing its "sensitivity" based on how fast the object is moving.

How it works (The Logic)
When you are still (Low Speed): The filter assumes any small changes are just noise (jitter). It applies strong smoothing (low cutoff frequency) to keep the keypoints stable and steady.
When you are moving (High Speed): The filter assumes the changes are deliberate motion. It applies weak smoothing (high cutoff frequency) to follow your movement instantly, reducing the feeling of "lag".
The Parameters
In the 
call
(self, t, x)
 function, the filter takes the current timestamp t and value x and uses these parameters:

min_cutoff (Minimum Cutoff Frequency)
Meaning: The baseline smoothing level when the object is stationary.
Effect:
Lower (e.g., 0.1): Very stable when still, but can feel "floaty" or slow to start moving.
Higher (e.g., 1.0): Responsive, but you might see the keypoints "shaking" even when the dancer is standing still.
beta (Speed Coefficient)
Meaning: How aggressively the filter "wakes up" when it detects motion. It controls the slope of the adaptation.
Effect:
Higher (e.g., 20.0): The filter drastically reduces smoothing as soon as it detects speed. This reduces lag significantly during fast dance moves.
Lower (e.g., 1.0): The filter remains somewhat "heavy" even during movement, which might look smoother but will trail behind the real dancer (lag).
d_cutoff (Derivative Cutoff)
Meaning: A secondary filter just for calculating the speed (derivative) itself.
Effect: Usually kept at 1.0. It ensures that a single noisy frame doesn't trick the filter into thinking there's a huge burst of speed.
Return Value
The function returns x_hat, which is the new filtered position. You use this value instead of the raw landmark coordinate to draw your skeleton or save your data.

In summary: By increasing beta to 20.0 in the previous step, we told the filter: "As soon as the dancer moves, trust the new data more and stop smoothing so much," which is why the keypoints should feel snappier now.
