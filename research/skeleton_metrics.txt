Skeleton metrics are fully implemented and verified. Here's the summary:

4 functions implemented in skeleton_metrics.py:

compute_joint_angles — 2D angles via dot product
compute_cog — weighted center of gravity
compare_angles — exponential decay scoring with per-joint tolerances
compare_cog — CoG distance scoring
Config additions — angle_sigma=25°, cog_sigma=0.05, weight_angles=0.80, weight_cog=0.20

Comparator updated — Phase B now combines angle score (80%) + CoG score (20%) into the skeleton score.

All tests pass: 90° angle computed correctly, identical sequences → 100, 80° error → 0.2, CoG scoring scales properly in the 0–1 coordinate space.

Catch during verification: Initially set cog_sigma=15.0 (thinking in pixels), but your landmarks are in 0–1 normalized coordinates. Fixed to 0.05 — meaning a ~5% CoG shift drops the score to ~37%.
